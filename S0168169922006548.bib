abstract = {Accurate prediction of crop yield before harvest is of great importance for crop logistics, market planning, and food distribution around the world. Yield prediction requires monitoring of phenological and climatic characteristics over extended time periods to model the complex relations involved in crop development. Remote sensing satellite images provided by various satellites circumnavigating the world are a cheap and reliable way to obtain data for yield prediction. The field of yield prediction is currently dominated by Deep Learning approaches. While the accuracies reached with those approaches are promising, the needed amounts of data and the “black-box” nature can restrict the application of Deep Learning methods. The limitations can be overcome by proposing a pipeline to process remote sensing images into feature-based representations that allow the employment of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for yield prediction. A comparative evaluation of soybean yield prediction within the United States shows promising prediction accuracies compared to state-of-the-art yield prediction systems based on Deep Learning. Feature importances expose the near-infrared spectrum of light as an important feature within our models. The reported results hint at the capabilities of XGBoost for yield prediction and encourage future experiments with XGBoost for yield prediction on other crops in regions all around the world.}
